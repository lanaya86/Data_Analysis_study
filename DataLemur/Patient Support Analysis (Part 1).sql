--UnitedHealth Group (UHG) has a program called Advocate4Me, which allows policy holders (or, members) 
--to call an advocate and receive support for their health care needs – 
--whether that's claims and benefits support, drug coverage, pre- and post-authorisation, medical records, emergency assistance, or member portal services.
--Write a query to find how many UHG policy holders made three, or more calls, assuming each call is identified by the case_id column.

SELECT COUNT(*) AS policy_holder_count
FROM  (SELECT COUNT( DISTINCT case_id) AS cases__per_user
              FROM callers 
              GROUP BY policy_holder_id 
              HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT case_id) >= 3) AS sub
