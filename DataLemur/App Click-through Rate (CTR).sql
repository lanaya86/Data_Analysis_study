--This is the same question as problem #1 in the SQL Chapter of Ace the Data Science Interview!
--Assume you have an events table on Facebook app analytics. Write a query to calculate the click-through rate (CTR) for the app in 2022 and round the results to 2 decimal places.
--Definition and note:
--Percentage of click-through rate (CTR) = 100.0 * Number of clicks / Number of impressions
--To avoid integer division, multiply the CTR by 100.0, not 100.

SELECT 
      app_id,
      ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(CASE WHEN event_type = 'click' THEN 1 END) / 
      COUNT(CASE WHEN event_type = 'impression' THEN 1 END), 2) AS ctr

FROM events
WHERE date_part('year', timestamp) = 2022
GROUP BY app_id
